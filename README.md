# Plasma Donor

**Overview**:

Since the inception of COVID-19, the world has seen an immensely colossal number of affected people. With 17.8M cases in the world(1.7M in India) and no possible diagnosis available worldwide, the regime has no other option rather than treating the patients to fight the infection with the blood plasma of the people who have completely recovered from COVID-19. But the problem that persists is the low supply of plasma donors i.e. less number of people willing to donate blood plasma or being able to volunteer for it. Moreover, there exists an enormous gap between the existing system as the family members of the affected patients have to rely upon the hospital for the supply of blood plasma. Additionally, a proper contact/donation platform for the blood plasma doesn't exist that may avail the victim's family members to get the plasma.

**How does Blood Plasma help?**

The plasma of the patients who successfully fought the infection now contains COVID-19 antibodies. These antibodies provided one way for your immune system to fight the virus when you were sick, so your plasma may be able to be used to help others fight off the disease. Antibodies are proteins that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19.


**Our solution:**

We propose a blockchain-based platform for people to volunteer to donate blood plasma. Using our Dapp, the recovered patients can volunteer to donate plasma, and those who need blood plasma can now choose volunteer people based on their location and ask them for their help. The platform will reduce the gap between the demand and supply of plasma donors and increases the availability and access for Covid-19 patients to contact potential plasma donors. This will help in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases and ultimately lower the spreading of the infection exponentially.

**Features :**

1) Easy to register yourself as the blood plasma donor(if you are a recovered patient).
2) Contact the donor with email/phone based on your location(if you are a victim's family member).
3) A more trustable data source through a trustless system
  Yes, we are talking about integrating the **Ethereum blockchain network**. Ethereum is popular for its immutable, decentralized yet transparent environment. Along with the power of **Matic** system, we can build a more effective and affordable database system.
The need arose from the rising number of accusations on governments all around the world and in India, mainly due to the lack of transparency and immutability, where you can tamper with the data without anyone noticing. Since all the transactions get noted down on the Ethereum network forever, it will build a system that people can trust.
4) Tamper Proof Data
   Decentralized, so that it helps the community.
5) Deployed on Matic network, for instant transactions.
6) Uses Portis wallet, for Faster and Easier authentication
